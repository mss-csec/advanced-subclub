:toc: macro

minimum spanning tree:: _n._ a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all nodes together without any cycles and with the minimum possible edge weight; that is, a spanning tree with minimal total weight.

== Who cares?

A minimum spanning tree is useful for *minimizing costs* when connecting nodes in a graph, such as link:++http://wcipeg.com/problem/ccc17s4++[which pipelines to keep in a sewer system during budget cuts].

The idea of a _minimum_ spanning tree can be flipped on its head.
Consider a scenario where weights denote restrictions on edges, such as link:++http://wcipeg.com/problem/ccc03s5++[the maximum weight that can be driven across a bridge].
Then, to find the _maximum_ weight that can be driven across the network, you just need to find the *maximum* spanning tree.

== Prim's Algorithm

image:++https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/PrimAlgDemo.gif/220px-PrimAlgDemo.gif++[prim's algorithm on euclidian distance, role="right"]

First developed by Czech mathematician link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vojt%C4%9Bch_Jarn%C3%ADk++[Jarnik] in 1930 and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Prim++[Prim] and link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra++[Dijkstra], Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph with \(N\) nodes and \(M\) edges in \(\text{O}(N\log{M})\) time with the tools we have.

=== Basic Algorithm

. Begin with one nodefootnote:[any works.].
This node is part of your minimum spanning tree.
. Iterate until all nodes have been added:
.. Find the lowest-weight edge that connects from a node currently in the tree to a node not yet in the tree.
.. Add that edge and the node connected from it to the tree.

=== Intuition of Correctness

The link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm#Proof_of_correctness++[proof] that this works can be understood by induction.

. A single node from the graph must, by definition, be a part of the minimum spanning tree.
. Adding the _least-cost_ node from the tree to the tree ensures that the two now-connected nodes are connected by the least-weight edge.

=== Implementation

There are a number of considerations to be had when implementing Prim's Algorithm.

The following is sample pseudocode:

[source,cpp]
----
struct less_weight //<1>
{
    bool operator<(edge_t a, edge_t b)
    {
        //priority_queues are max-heaps, but we want min
        return a.weight > b.weight;
    }
};

graph_t prim(graph_t g)
{
    graph_t mst;
    mst.add_node(g.nodes[0]); //<2>
    
    std::priority_queue<edge_t, std::vector<edge_t>, less_weight> choices; //<3>
    for (each edge_t e in g.nodes[0])
        choices.push(e);
    
    while (mst.num_nodes < g.num_nodes)
    {
    	if (mst.contains_node(choices.top().to_node)) //<4>
        {
            choices.pop();
            continue;
        }
        
        mst.add_node(choices.top().to_node);
        mst.add_edge(choices.top());
        
        node_t n = choices.top().to_node;
        choices.pop();
        
        for (each edge_t e in n)
            choices.push(e);
    }
    
    return mst;
}

<1> A functor for STL comparisons
<2> Step 1: add _some_ node to your MST
<3> To carry out step 2a, we'll keep track of _all available_ choices for the next edge to add in a binary heap.
This contributes to the \(\log{M}\) factor in the time complexity.
<4> We do need to consider that an edge may connect two nodes already in the MST.
In practice, this is usually accomplished by an array of ``bool``s, the \(i\)th element denoting if the \(i\)th node is yet in the MST.

== Kruskal's Algorithm

image:++https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/KruskalDemo.gif/220px-KruskalDemo.gif++[kruskal's algorithm on euclidean distance, role="right"]

Developed by American computer scientist link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kruskal++[Kruskal], and can find the minimum spanning tree of a graph with \(N\) nodes and \(M\) edges in \(\text{O}(M\log{M})\) time, or equivalently, \(\text{O}(M\log{N})\) time.

=== Basic Algorithm

. Sort the \(M\) edges by weight.
. Consider each node their own individual tree, forming an \(N\)-node, \(0\)-edge forest, and add them to the MST.
. Iterate: take the least-weight not-yet-traversed edge.
.. If this edge connects two nodes in separate (unconnected) trees, join the two trees together.

=== Intuition of Correctness

I'm tired, so this is left as an exercise for the reader.

=== Implementation

Pseudocode:
[source,cpp]
----
struct less_weight //<1>
{
    bool operator<(edge_t a, edge_t b)
    {
        //priority_queues are max-heaps, but we want min
        return a.weight > b.weight;
    }
};

graph_t prim(graph_t g)
{
    std::deque<edge_t> all_edges = g.edges; //<1>
    std::sort(all_edges.begin(), all_edges.end(), less_weight);

    graph_t mst; //<2>
    for (each node_t n in g.nodes)
        mst.add_node(n);
        
    dijoint_set_t<g.num_nodes> connectivity; //<3>
    
    while (connectivity.num_sets > 1)
    {
    	if (connectivity.find(all_edges.front().from) !=
            connectivity.find(all_edges.front().to))
        {
            connectivity.union(all_edges.front().from, all_edges.front().to);
            mst.add_edge(all_edges.front());
        }
        all_edges.pop_front();
    }
    
    return mst;
}

<1> Step 1; I'm using a deque here because there's less to write later.
<2> Step 2.
<3> It's very useful to make a disjoint-set structure for checking if two nodes are in the same tree.
