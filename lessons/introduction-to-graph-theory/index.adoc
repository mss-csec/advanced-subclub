A *graph* is a collection of *vertices* and *edges*, or of *nodes* and *connections*.
In the above graph, we have six vertices (or nodes) and seven edges (or connections) between the six vertices.
For example, one of these edges connects vertices 4 and 6 in the top-left.

NOTE: For the purposes of this course, we will mostly refer to vertices and nodes as *nodes* and edges or connections as *edges*.

*_Graph Theory_* is the study of graphs, their properties, and their applications.

== Properties of Graphs

Graphs have a number of *nodes* and a number of *edges*.
Edges will often have *weights*, where
