A *graph* is a collection of *vertices* and *edges*, or of *nodes* and *connections*.
In the above graph, we have six vertices (or nodes) and seven edges (or connections) between the six vertices.
For example, one of these edges connects vertices 4 and 6 in the top-left.

NOTE: For the purposes of this course, we will mostly refer to vertices and nodes as *nodes* and edges or connections as *edges*.

*_Graph Theory_* is the study of graphs, their properties, and their applications.

== Properties of Graphs

Graphs have a number of *nodes* and a number of *edges*.

Edges may have *weights*; these commonly denote some sort of _cost_ to "traverse" or _distance_ of an edge.
Typically you see these with most applications of graphs.

Graphs can have *cycles*: a series of distinct edges that lead back to the beginning.
In the above example graph, we have the cycles:

stem:[4\rightarrow 5\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 4],

stem:[5\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 5],

stem:[4\rightarrow 5\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 4],

and their reverses and rotations.
A graph without cycles is *acyclic*.

So far, we looked at *undirected graphs* with bidirectional edges, but sometimes edges are *directed* and can only be traversed in one direction.

Here, we have the cycles:

stem:[1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 4\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 1],

stem:[1\rightarrow 4\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 1], and

stem:[2\rightarrow 4\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 2].

Not all graphs are *connected*, as we've seen so far.
They can also be *disconnected*, where you have at least two *subgraphs* that constitute the larger graph but aren't connected to each other with an edge.

Here, subgraphs stem:[\{0\}] and stem:[\{1,2,2,3,3,3\}] are internally connected, but not to each other.
The graph overall is disconnected.

These have very interesting properties that will be explored later.

*Forests* are collections of disconnected trees.

Now that I've thrown at you all these terms you have yet to see a use for, it's time to move on to Implementations and Applications of Graph Theory.
