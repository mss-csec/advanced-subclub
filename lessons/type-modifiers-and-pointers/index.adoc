= Type Modifiers and Pointers

You were probably taught that "variables hold a value," and that "different types hold different types of values."

The first statement is correct, but doesn't show the full picture of what a variable is.
The second statment is wrong.

== What is a variable?

In programming, a *variable* refers to a segment of memory which is to be read from or written to during calculations.

This segment of memory has a specific *length*. Standard ``int``s today are four bytes long. Since a bit can only store a certain amount of information, and bytes are collections of eight bits, there is only so much information that a four-byte ``int`` can hold.

Specifically, one of the thirty-two bits must be used to hold the sign of the number.
The rest thirty-one are used to indicate the magnitude of the number.
As such, a thirty-two bit ``int`` (or ``int32``) can store integers between, inclusive, \(-2,147,483,648\) and \(2,147,483,647\).

A *type* does not refer to the type of value that is _stored_, but rather the type of value that should be _interpreted_ from the stored data.
A ``float``, for example, which stores the value of \(\sqrt{2}\) to its highest precision, will be interpreted as something like \(1.414214\). However, if you interpret its data as an ``int``, then you'll get \(1,068,827,891\).

It's kind of like words across different languages.
In English, "die" means _to cease living_.
In Dutch, "die" means _this one_.
They're denoted -- stored -- the same way, but the _interpretation_ is different, which leads to unfortunate misunderstandings like this:

=== Variables in Memory

[quote, "Me, in like the first paragraph"]
In programming, a *variable* refers to a segment of memory which is to be read from or written to during calculations.

Variables are put into segments of memory.
So what's memory?

I'm sure you're familiar with what RAM sticks are: they're your "working memory" while your computer runs.
Each stick of RAM is delimited into little chunks of eight bits called _bytes_.
So that we can find these bytes, each and every one of them has an *address*.

You can think of working memory as a giant warehouse.

image:++https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1625857.main_image.jpg?strip=all++[Amazon warehouse; source: The Sun]

In each little shelf is a small sheet of paper, holding an eight-bit binary number (or, if you wish, a number between 0 and 255).

The CPU is like a little office in the next building over.
It doesn't understand what's going on; all it does is take instructions and carry them out.

One instruction says to assign byte \(\text{2300003A}_{16}\)footnote:[this is hexadecimal, a 16-digit base (or radix) for numbers. It's a common way to represent binary numbers, since it's much more compact than writing every bit out. This way, each digit represents one *nibble*, or half-byte.] the value at byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\).
The CPU (office) requests for byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\) from the RAM (warehouse), and so the workers at the warehouse retrieve this data for the CPU.
The CPU then reads that the data is \(\text{00}_{16}\), and so tells the warehouse to assign byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\) the value \(\text{00}_{16}\).

This is what an assignment between variables actually isfootnote:[actually there's also the *cache* between the RAM and CPU, which speeds up this retrieval process. But that's not so important to know right now.]: the CPU requests from RAM, then tells RAM to change a value.

Now, most types take _more_ than one byte, but the same process still works.
If you're using ``int``s (four bytes), then the CPU will request four bytes and tell memory to assign four bytes.
If you're working with ``float``s (four bytes), then the CPU will request and ask to write four bytes, but will use floating-point operations instead.

Consider what the following code does:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
	int i = 07 j = 5;
    int k = i + j;
{% endhighlight %}
++++

The CPU, reading these instructions, will assign memory values to each ``int``.
If we say that ``i`` is address ``100``, ``j`` is at ``104``, and ``k`` is at ``108``, then the process will be something like this:

 . CPU tells RAM to assign ``100`` (four bytes) to ``00000007``
 . CPU tells RAM to assign ``104`` (four bytes) to ``00000005``
 . CPU requests the values of addresses ``100`` (four bytes) and ``104`` (four bytes), obtaining ``000000007`` and ``00000005``
 . CPU adds these values together , obtaining ``0000000C``
 . CPU tells RAM to assign ``108`` (four bytes) to ``0000000C``

=== Type Modifiers

Notice that we are specifying how many bytes to to assign and request.
What if we only needed to use two bytes for our variable?
What if we needed more than four bytes, because we expect to use numbers larger than \(2,147,483,647\)?
What if we don't need to store negatives in our variable?

This is where *type modifiers* come in.
They modify the lengths and behaviours of variables.

There's a few you should know about:

- ``short``: halves the length of a variable.
Applicable to ``int`` only.
- ``long``: doubles the length of a variable.
Applicable to ``int``, ``long``footnote:[due to legacy issues, the ``long`` is a 4-byte ``int``. ``long int`` _may_ actually refer to a 4-byte int depending on your operating system, and so if you want an 8-byte int you'll need a ``long long``.], ``char``, and ``double``footnote:[actually, it makes ``double``s 12 bytes long up from 8 bytes; doubles are already  "long floats."]
- ``unsigned``: the first bit of the variable will now be used as another digit rather than a sign indicator.
Applicable to ``int``, ``long``, and ``char``.
- ``signed``: opposite of above. Not really too useful, since it isn't really necessary much of the time.
- ``const``: prevents this variable from being altered.
This is actually a compile-time behaviour, and doesn't affect how the hardware handles things.
- ``static``: declares this variable with a global lifetime, despite that it may be in a non-global scope.
Not particularly useful for your purposes.

There are many questions where you may be asked to compute something very large; these are where ``long long``s become vital.

=== Pointers

Recall our little exercise at the end of the _Variables in Memory_ section.

Addresses are just numbers -- four-byte numbers, at that, if you're running 32-bit programsfootnote:[if you're running 64-bit programs, they're eight bytes.].
What if you wanted to say "hey, get me the value stored at the address indicated by that variable"?

Essentially, you're setting a variable to *reference* some address in memory.

Now, they're not actually references.

Yes, I'm doing this again.

This is *important*.

Pointers are not actually references.
====

Pointers merely store a number.
When _interpreted_ as a pointer, it _refers_ to an address.
But _only_ when interpreted with the right instructions.

Changing the value of the pointer _itself_ will only move the "arrow of reference."
It doesn't change what the pointer is pointing to.

To use it, you must *dereference* it first by telling the CPU, "hey, instead of just changing this address, change the address that this address stores."

Take a second to digest that sentence; the distinctions are important.
