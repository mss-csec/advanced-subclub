= Type Modifiers and Pointers

You were probably taught that "variables hold a value," and that "different types hold different types of values."

The first statement is correct, but doesn't show the full picture of what a variable is.
The second statement is wrong.

== What is a variable?

In programming, a *variable* refers to a segment of memory which is to be read from or written to during calculations.

This segment of memory has a specific *length*. Standard ``int``s today are four bytes long. Since a bit can only store a certain amount of information, and bytes are collections of eight bits, there is only so much information that a four-byte ``int`` can hold.

Specifically, one of the thirty-two bits must be used to hold the sign of the number.
The rest thirty-one are used to indicate the magnitude of the number.
As such, a thirty-two bit ``int`` (or ``int32``) can store integers between, inclusive, \(-2,147,483,648\) and \(2,147,483,647\).

A *type* does not refer to the type of value that is _stored_, but rather the type of value that should be _interpreted_ from the stored data.
A ``float``, for example, which stores the value of \(\sqrt{2}\) to its highest precision, will be interpreted as something like \(1.414214\). However, if you interpret its data as an ``int``, then you'll get \(1,068,827,891\).

It's kind of like words across different languages.
In English, "die" means _to cease living_.
In Dutch, "die" means _this one_.
They're denoted -- stored -- the same way, but the _interpretation_ is different, which leads to unfortunate misunderstandings like this:

=== Variables in Memory

[quote, "Me, in like the first paragraph"]
In programming, a *variable* refers to a segment of memory which is to be read from or written to during calculations.

Variables are put into segments of memory.
So what's memory?

I'm sure you're familiar with what RAM sticks are: they're your "working memory" while your computer runs.
Each stick of RAM is delimited into little chunks of eight bits called _bytes_.
So that we can find these bytes, each and every one of them has an *address*.

You can think of working memory as a giant warehouse.

image:++https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1625857.main_image.jpg?strip=all++[Amazon warehouse; source: The Sun]

In each little shelf is a small sheet of paper, holding an eight-bit binary number (or, if you wish, a number between 0 and 255).

The CPU is like a little office in the next building over.
It doesn't understand what's going on; all it does is take instructions and carry them out.

One instruction says to assign byte \(\text{2300003A}_{16}\)footnote:[this is hexadecimal, a 16-digit base (or radix) for numbers. It's a common way to represent binary numbers, since it's much more compact than writing every bit out. This way, each digit represents one *nibble*, or half-byte.] the value at byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\).
The CPU (office) requests for byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\) from the RAM (warehouse), and so the workers at the warehouse retrieve this data for the CPU.
The CPU then reads that the data is \(\text{00}_{16}\), and so tells the warehouse to assign byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\) the value \(\text{00}_{16}\).

This is what an assignment between variables actually isfootnote:[actually there's also the *cache* between the RAM and CPU, which speeds up this retrieval process. But that's not so important to know right now.]: the CPU requests from RAM, then tells RAM to change a value.

Now, most types take _more_ than one byte, but the same process still works.
If you're using ``int``s (four bytes), then the CPU will request four bytes and tell memory to assign four bytes.
If you're working with ``float``s (four bytes), then the CPU will request and ask to write four bytes, but will use floating-point operations instead.

Consider what the following code does:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    int i = 0, j = 5;
    int k = i + j;
{% endhighlight %}
++++

The CPU, reading these instructions, will assign memory values to each ``int``.
If we say that ``i`` is address ``100``, ``j`` is at ``104``, and ``k`` is at ``108``, then the process will be something like this:

 . CPU tells RAM to assign ``100`` (four bytes) to ``00000007``
 . CPU tells RAM to assign ``104`` (four bytes) to ``00000005``
 . CPU requests the values of addresses ``100`` (four bytes) and ``104`` (four bytes), obtaining ``000000007`` and ``00000005``
 . CPU adds these values together , obtaining ``0000000C``
 . CPU tells RAM to assign ``108`` (four bytes) to ``0000000C``

=== Type Modifiers

Notice that we are specifying how many bytes to to assign and request.
What if we only needed to use two bytes for our variable?
What if we needed more than four bytes, because we expect to use numbers larger than \(2,147,483,647\)?
What if we don't need to store negatives in our variable?

This is where *type modifiers* come in.
They modify the lengths and behaviours of variables.

There's a few you should know about:

- ``short``: halves the length of a variable.
Applicable to ``int`` only.
- ``long``: doubles the length of a variable.
Applicable to ``int``, ``long``footnote:[due to legacy issues, the ``long`` is a 4-byte ``int``. ``long int`` _may_ actually refer to a 4-byte int depending on your operating system, and so if you want an 8-byte int you'll need a ``long long``.], ``char``, and ``double``footnote:[actually, it makes ``double``s 12 bytes long up from 8 bytes; doubles are already  "long floats."]
- ``unsigned``: the first bit of the variable will now be used as another digit rather than a sign indicator.
Applicable to ``int``, ``long``, and ``char``.
- ``signed``: opposite of above. Not really too useful, since it isn't really necessary much of the time.
- ``const``: prevents this variable from being altered.
This is actually a compile-time behaviour, and doesn't affect how the hardware handles things.
- ``static``: declares this variable with a global lifetime, despite that it may be in a non-global scope.
Not particularly useful for your purposes.

There are many questions where you may be asked to compute something very large; these are where ``long long``s become vital.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    short int si;       //declare a short int (2-byte int) called si
    long long ll;       //declare a long long (8-byte int) called ll
    unsigned int ui;    //declare an unsigned int (4-byte u-int) called ui
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Oftentimes the standard library will use types like ``uint32_t``, or ``size_t``.
The link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdint/++[<stdint.h>] and link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstddef/++[<stddef.h>] libraries contains these types.
If you get compiler errors that mention these, now you might know what the heck they are!

=== Pointers

Recall our little exercise at the end of the _Variables in Memory_ section.

Addresses are just numbers -- four-byte numbers, at that, if you're running 32-bit programsfootnote:[if you're running 64-bit programs, they're eight bytes.].
What if you wanted to say "hey, get me the value stored at the address indicated by that variable"?

image:++https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Pointers.svg/220px-Pointers.svg.png++[a pointer; source: wikipedia]

Essentially, you're setting a variable to *reference* some address in memory.

Now, they're not actually references.
[IMPORTANT]
====
Pointers are not actually references.
====
[IMPORTANT]
====
Pointers are *not* actually references.
====

Pointers merely store a number.
When _interpreted_ as a pointer, it _refers_ to an address.
But this is _only_ when interpreted with the right instructions.

Changing the value of the pointer _itself_ will only move the "arrow of reference."
It doesn't change what the pointer is pointing to.

To use it, you must *dereference* it first by telling the CPU, "hey, instead of just changing this address (the pointer), change the address (the address "referenced" by the pointer) that this address (the pointer) stores."

Take a second to digest that sentence; the distinctions are important.

There's a few new operations you now need to know:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    int a = 5;
    int *p;
    p = &a;
    *p += 50;
    new p[a];
    *p = 0;
    *(p+1) = 1;
    p[2] = 2;
    delete[] p;
    p = NULL;
{% endhighlight %}
++++

- Line 2: when declaring a pointer, an asterick must be placed *before* the variable name, which denotes it as a pointer.
This is a *type modifier*, applicable to _all_ typesfootnote:[a pointer is a type, and so you can have a pointer to a pointer. Or a pointer to a pointer to a pointer. Or a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer... you get the point. You'd declare it as ``int pass:[*****] fifth_dimentional_pointer``.].
Whitespace does not matter: ``int * p``, ``int* p``, ``int *p``, ``int*p`` all do the same thingfootnote:[you can declare different levels of pointers on the same line: ``pass:[int a, *b, **c]`` gives you an int a, a pointer to int b, and a pointer to a pointer to int c.].
- Line 3: to set a pointer point to another variable, use the *addressof* operator. In C++, that's ``&``.
- Line 4: to actually use the memory you're referring to, you have to *dereference* a pointer with the dereference operator ``pass:[*]``footnote:[the dereference operator has *a lower* precedence than the access operator ``.``; if you're using a pointer to a ``struct`` or ``class``, then you need specify that you're dereferencing _first_: ``pass:[(*obj).member]``. There is a shorthand for this: ``pass:[obj->member]`` does the same thing.]
- Line 5: you can dynamically allocate memory using the ``new`` and ``new[]`` operator. In this case, ``p`` became a pointer "pointing to an array"footnote:[it isn't, it's pointing a memory location which the _operating system_ treats as a _contiguous block of memory_. It can act like an array, but it needn't.] of length 55 (that was the value of ``a``).
- Line 6: dereferencing ``p`` now refers to the "first element" of "the array".
- Line 7: to access the next element, go 1 block after the location specified by ``p``. This is why arrays are zero-indexed.
- Line 8: as a shorthand to the previous notation, you can use the *index* operator for quick pointer arithmetic.
- Line 9: when you're done with memory, ``delete`` it.
If you keep asking for more memory, then you'll run out sometime and you'll get a segfault.
No one likes a segfault.
- Line 10: if a pointer isn't in use -- that is, it's not referring to anything useful -- then it should be assigned to ``NULL``.
Attempting to dereference a null pointer will immediately crash your program, which will immediately tell you whether or not you've made an incorrect reference.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Why use null pointers if they'll crash your program?
The alternatives are likely worse.

If you delete memory, but leave your pointer pointing to that deleted (no longer yours) memory, you'll have a *dangling pointer*.
Some other process might then grab that memory.
What if that other process is your operating system?

What if you then write over that memory _that your operating system is using_?

At least you can check if a pointer is null by checking equality: ``p == NULL``.
====
[NOTE]
====
Notice that with pointer arithmetic we can pretty much add or subtract anything we want.
If you really wanted, you can try accessing ``p[55]``, despite it being past the length of the array.

Or ``p[-1]``.

Be careful when using pointers and indicies in {cpp}; you'll need to keep track of everything yourself.
====

Because of how pointers can be used to dynamically refer to memory, they are extremely helpful.

==== Memory and String Manipulation with link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/++[``<string.h>``]

Recall that in the link:++https://mss-csec.github.io/lessons/advanced/introduction-to-cpp/#strings++[last lesson] that I mentioned that you can use ``char[]`` for strings.
Since ``char*``footnote:[pointer to ``char``] can _also_ be an array of ``char``, they can also be strings.
In C, this is exactly what strings are: ``char*``.

Memory and string manipulation in the ``<string.h>`` library work exclusively with pointers.
The most important function you need to know is ``memset()``.

If you'd like to really practice working with pointers, try writing your own versions of some of the functions in ``<string.h>``, starting with ``memset()`` and ``memcpy()``.

==== Pointers in STL Functions

Many functions in the standard library use pointers to denote the beginning and end of rangesfootnote:[if you have two pointers, ``l``, the "beginning" of the range, and ``r``, the end, then the range will _include_ ``l`` and _exclude_ ``r``. In interval notation, that's ``[l,r).``]:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    int arr[]={9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0}; //size 10
    std::vector<int> varr(arr, arr+10);
    std::sort(arr, arr+10);
    std::cout << std::min_element(arr, arr+10);
{% endhighlight %}
++++

- Line 2: you can construct an ``std::vector`` from an array with its link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/++[range constructor].
- Line 3: you can sort a range with link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/++[``std::sort``].
- Line 4: you can find a minimum element with link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/min_element/++[``std::min_element``].

==== Multidimensional Arrays

In many languages, you can have multidimensional arrays.
In {cpp}, we don't worry about classifying what arrays are single-dimensional and what are multidimensional, because a two-dimensional array is just an array of arraysfootnote:[actually, "multidimensional arrays" as a specific type _do_ have some optimizations over "arrays of arrays", but they aren't particularly important here.].
A three-dimensional array is just an array of arrays of arrays.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
	//make a 10x10 multiplication table
    int **two_d_arr = new int*[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
        two_d_arr[i] = new int[10];
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; ++j)
            two_d_arr[i][j] = i * j;
    }
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Line 7 is equivalent to ``pass:[*(*(two_d_arr+i)+j) = i * j;]``
