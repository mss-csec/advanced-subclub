= Type Modifiers and Pointers

You were probably taught that "variables hold a value," and that "different types hold different types of values."

The first statement is correct, but doesn't show the full picture of what a variable is.
The second statment is wrong.

== What is a variable?

In programming, a *variable* refers to a segment of memory which is to be read from or written to during calculations.

This segment of memory has a specific *length*. Standard ``int``s today are four bytes long. Since a bit can only store a certain amount of information, and bytes are collections of eight bits, there is only so much information that a four-byte ``int`` can hold.

Specifically, one of the thirty-two bits must be used to hold the sign of the number.
The rest thirty-one are used to indicate the magnitude of the number.
As such, a thirty-two bit ``int`` (or ``int32``) can store integers between, inclusive, \(-2,147,483,648\) and \(2,147,483,647\).

A *type* does not refer to the type of value that is _stored_, but rather the type of value that should be _interpreted_ from the stored data.
A ``float``, for example, which stores the value of \(\sqrt{2}\) to its highest precision, will be interpreted as something like \(1.414214\). However, if you interpret its data as an ``int``, then you'll get \(1,068,827,891\).

It's kind of like words across different languages.
In English, "die" means _to cease living_.
In Dutch, "die" means _this one_.
They're denoted -- stored -- the same way, but the _interpretation_ is different, which leads to unfortunate misunderstandings like this:

=== Variables in Memory

[quote, "Me, in like the first paragraph"]
In programming, a *variable* refers to a segment of memory which is to be read from or written to during calculations.

Variables are put into segments of memory.
So what's memory?

I'm sure you're familiar with what RAM sticks are: they're your "working memory" while your computer runs.
Each stick of RAM is delimited into little chunks of eight bits called _bytes_.
So that we can find these bytes, each and every one of them has an *address*.

You can think of working memory as a giant warehouse.

In each little shelf is a small sheet of paper, holding an eight-bit binary number (or, if you wish, a number between 0 and 255).

The CPU is like a little office in the next building over.
It doesn't understand what's going on; all it does is take instructions and carry them out.

One instruction says to assign byte \(\text{2300003A}_{16}\)footnote:[this is hexadecimal, a 16-digit base (or radix) for numbers. It's a common way to represent binary numbers, since it's much more compact than writing every bit out. This way, each digit represents one *nibble*, or half-byte.] the value at byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\).
The CPU (office) requests for byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\) from the RAM (warehouse), and so the workers at the warehouse retrieve this data for the CPU.
The CPU then reads that the data is \(\text{00}_{16}\), and so tells the warehouse to assign byte \(\text{23000038}_{16}\) the value \(\text{00}_{16}\).

This is what an assignment between variables actually isfootnote:[actually there's also the *cache* between the RAM and CPU, which speeds up this retrieval process. But that's not so important to know right now.]: the CPU requests from RAM, then tells RAM to change a value.

Now, most types take _more_ than one byte, but the same process still works. If you're using ``int``s (four bytes), then the CPU will request four bytes and tell memory to assign four bytes.
