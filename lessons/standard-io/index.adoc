= Standard I/O

``std::cout`` and ``std::cin`` from the ``<iostream>`` library is bad.

Now that you can use pointers, you should be using ``printf`` and ``scanf`` from the ``<stdio.h>`` library.footnote:[you don't have to, of course, but we'll be very disappointed.]

== Why link:++http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/++[``<stdio.h>``] is better

The following two snippets of code do the same thingfootnote:[not exactly, the second one (with ``<stdio.h>``) actually works faster]:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    std::string name;
    int age;
    //...
    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " and you are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
{% endhighlight $}
++++

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    std::string name;
    int age;
    //...
    printf("Your name is %s and you are %d years old.", name.c_str(), age);
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Which looks easier to read?

The following two snippets of code do the same thing:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>
    //...
    std::string name[30];
    int age[30];
    //...
    std::cout << std::left << std::setw(20) << " Name" << std::right << std::setw(5) << "Age" << std::endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 30; ++i)
        std::cout << " " << std::left << std::setw(19) << name[i] << std::right << std::setw(5) << age[i] << std::endl;
{% endhighlight $}
++++

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
    std::string name[30];
    int age[30];
    //...
    printf(" Name                 Age\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 30; ++i)
        printf(" %19s%5d\n", name[i].c_str(), age[i]);
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Which do you think took longer to reference and write?

== ``<stdio.h>`` with ``std::string``

Before scanning, ``reserve`` enough space in the string.

Then just ``scanf("%s", str.data());``.

To print, just ``printf("%s", str.c_str());``.
