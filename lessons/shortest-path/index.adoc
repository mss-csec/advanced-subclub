shortest path:: _n._ a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects two specific nodes together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

== Who cares?

The answer is trivial and is left as an exercise to the readerfootnote:[pathfinding, duh].

== Relaxing an Edge

Consider the graph on the right, where we are searching for a path from node *A* to node *F*.

The _true distance_ to node *A* is \(0\), as the total weight of the shortest path from *A* to *A* is \(0\).
Similarly, the true distance to node *B* is \(4\), to node *C* is \(2\), etc.

This is because the shortest path to *B* is \(A\rightarrow B\) with weight \(4\), and the shortest path the *C* is \(A\rightarrow C\) with weight \(2\); the only other path is \(A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\) with weight \(4+5=9\).

To find, then, the distance to node *D*, we must consider three paths:

stem:[A\rightarrow B\rightarrow D] with weight stem:[4+10=14],

stem:[A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\rightarrow E\rightarrow D], with weight stem:[4+5+3+4=16], and

stem:[A\rightarrow C\rightarrow E\rightarrow D], with weight stem:[2+3+4=9].

Since the third path has least weight, the true distance from node *A* to node *D* is \(9\).

Notice that we could have found this if we already knew the true distance from node *A* to nodes *B* or *E*: we could take that distance and add the weight of edges \(B\rightarrow D\) or \(E\rightarrow D\) respectively.

The act of doing so is called *relaxing* an edge: finding (and updating) the true distance of some node *Y* from edge \(X\rightarrow Y\).

== Dijkstra's Algorithm

image:++https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/DijkstraDemo.gif/220px-DijkstraDemo.gif++[dijkstra's algorithm on euclidean distance, role="right"]

Developed by link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra++[Edsger W. Dijkstra], Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a nonnegative-weighted graph with \(N\) nodes and \(M\) edges in \(\Theta(M\log{M})\) time using a binary heap.

=== Basic Algorithm

. Begin with true distance \(\infty\) for all nodes.
. Add the source node to the _open_ list with true distance \(0\).
. Until there are no more open nodes, or until the destination node is marked closed, iterate:
.. Pick the least true-distance open node.
.. Relax all edges from this node.
.. Close this node.

=== Intuition of Correctness

This is equivalent to what would be breadth-first search if, instead of merely considering recursive depth, the true distance of a node were considered instead.
As such, every node closed must be the next-closest open node to the source.

=== Implementation

[source,cpp]

struct less_true_dist //<1>
{
    bool operator<(edge_t a, edge_t b)
    {
        //priority_queues are max-heaps, but we want min
        return a.to.true_dist > b.to.true_dist;
    }
};

int dijkstra(graph_t g, node_t source, node_t dest)
{
    g.set_all_true_dist(MAXINT); //<2>

    std::priority_queue<edge_t, std::vector<edge_t>, less_true_dist> open_list;
    open_list.push(make_edge(NULL, source, 0, 0)); <3>
    
    while (!dest.closed() && !open_list.empty())
    {
    	edge_t next = open_list.top();
        open_list.pop();
        if (next.to.closed())
            continue;
        
        next.close(); <4>
        for (each edge_t e in next.to.edges)
        {
            if (!e.to.closed() && relax(e)) <5>
            {
            	open_list.push(e);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dest.true_dist;
}

<1> A functor for STL comparisons
<2> Step 1.
Usually you'd store these in an array.
<3> Step 2.
Assume that ``make_edge`` has signature ``edge_t make_edge(node_t from, node_t to, int weight, int true_dist)`` and parameters are passed by reference.
<4> Assume that this closes the node ``next.to``, automatically updating true distance.
<5> ``relax(edge_t e)`` updates node ``e.to`` with its true distance, if applicable, and returns ``true`` on an update; that is, a new least true distance was found.

== Bellman-Ford Algorithm

First proposed by Alfonso Shimbell in 1955 and later named after mathematicians Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr. who published it, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can find the shortest path in a graph with _negative_ weights or report the existence of a negative cycle in a graph with \(N\) nodes and \(M\) edges in \(\text{O}(NM)\) time.

=== Basic Algorithm

. Begin with true distance \(\infty\) for all nodes _except_ the source, which starts with true distance \(0\).
. Relax all \(M\) edges \(N\) times.
.. If any relaxing on the \(N^{\text{th}}\) pass succeeded, a negative cycle was found.

=== Intuition of Correctness

This is pretty much brute-force.

=== Implementation
