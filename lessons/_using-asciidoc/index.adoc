= Using AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc syntax is also supported.
Personally, I prefer AsciiDoc for its extensibility and flexibility, but the markup language you choose is your own choice.

== An explanation of the front-matter

The front-matter is the stuff between the two triple-hyphens (``---``) at the top of this file.
They should always be at the top without any preceding whitespace, never at the bottom, and most definitely not in the middle.
The front-matter consists of four fields, of the format ``:key: value``:

. The _liquid_ field, which tells ``jekyll-asciidoc`` to render Liquid.
    **Never, ever, EVER change this.
    If you do, a puppy dies and you lose the benefits of Liquid templating.**

. A _layout_ field, that states how this document will be rendered.
    It should be ``lesson`` and not anything else.

. A _category_ field, which states the subclub that this lesson belongs to.
    See the instructions in the README for further details.
    It should go without saying that this field *must* remain constant across all lessons from the same subclub.

. A _lesson_ field.
    This states what number this lesson is.
    So if the field is set to 1, this lesson will be treated as the first lesson, if it is set to 2, it will treated as the 2nd, etc.

All four fields are mandatory. If any of them are missing or malformed, the site may not compile and chances are your lesson will not appear.

Note that unlike the Markdown version, there is no explicit title field.
This is because the title is written right after the front matter --- it's the text just after the single equals sign.

== A review of AsciiDoc syntax

[NOTE]
====
This is _not_ meant to be a substitute for reading the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/[official documentation].
It is meant as a review of AsciiDoc syntax, assuming you are somewhat familiar with it already.
There are many subtleties in AsciiDoc that cannot be covered in this review.
====

== This is a big heading. Use it for sections.

=== This is a smaller heading. Use it for subsections.

==== This is a much smaller heading. Use it for subsubsections.

===== You can use up to

====== six hashes. The more hashes, the less prominent the heading level.

This is a paragraph.
It is recommended to type in the _one sentence per line_ style.
You don't have to use it, but it keeps things readable (and looks like poetry to boot).

Paragraphs are delimited by two linebreaks (``\n\n``).
However, you can force line breaks with a space followed by a plus (`` +``) at the end of a line. +
You can also *bold*, _italicize_, *_bold and italicize_*, or [line-through]#strikethrough#.
You can also link:https://www.google.ca[link to stuff],

and if you need inline code, ``use two backticks``.

* We
* also
* have
* lists.
** Nest them by increasing the number of list markers.

. Ordered
. lists
. are
.. supported
... too!
